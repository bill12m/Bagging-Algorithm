# Bagging-Algorithm
Project 2 from my graduate Data Mining course. Instructions are included below.

In this project you will apply bagging to implement an ensemble learning approach for solving a (binary) classification problem.
The training data set is given in Fig 3.36(the table labeled “training”)on page 189of the textbook(2ndedition). The base classifier 
will bea decision tree.Determine the number of base classifiers (or baggingrounds)and show the result of each round (which records 
are chosen at each roundandthe model (tree) obtained at each round).What is the result of running your ensemble classifier on the data 
set given in the second table (labeled “Validation”) in Fig 3.36on page 189of the textbook?Submit source code (do not use anypackage) 
and your output.
